# Base types {#base-types}

## Introduction

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

To talk about objects and OOP in R we need to first deal with a fundamental confusion: we use the word object to mean two different things. So far in this book, we've used object in a general sense, as captured by John Chambers' pithy quote: "Everything that exists in R is an object". However, while everything _is_ an object, not everything is "object-oriented". This confusion arises because the base objects come from S, and were developed before anyone was thinking that S might need an OOP system. The tools and nomenclature evolved organically over many years without a single guiding principle.

Most of the time, the distinction between objects and object-oriented objects is not important. But here we need to get into the nitty gritty details so we'll use the terms __base objects__ and __OO objects__ to distinguish them.

### Outline {-} 

* Section \@ref(base-vs-oo) shows you how to identify base and OO objects.

* Section \@ref(base-types-2) gives a complete set of the base types that all
  objects are built up from.
  
## Base vs OO objects {#base-vs-oo}
\indexc{is.object()}
\indexc{mode()}
\index{attributes!class}

To tell the difference between a base and OO object, use `is.object()`:

```{r}
# A base object:
is.object(1:10)

# An OO object
is.object(mtcars)
```

Or `sloop::otype()`:

```{r}
sloop::otype(1:10)

sloop::otype(mtcars)
```

Technically, the difference between base and OO objects is that OO objects have a "class" attribute:

```{r}
attr(1:10, "class")

attr(mtcars, "class")
```

In the next chapter you'll also learn about the `class()` function. For S3 objects, `class()` returns the class attribute. For base objects, `class()` returns the first element of "implicit" class, which you'll learn more about in Section \@ref(implicit-class).

## Base types {#base-types-2}
\indexc{mode()}
\indexc{typeof()}
 
While only OO objects have a class attribute, every object has a __base type__:

```{r}
typeof(1:10)

typeof(mtcars)
```

Base types do not form an OOP system because functions that behave differently for different base types are primarily written in C, where dispatch occurs using switch statements. This means only R-core can create new types, and creating a new type is a lot of work because every switch statement needs to be modified to handle a new case. As a consequence, new base types are rarely added. The most recent change, in 2011, added two exotic types that you never see in R, but are needed for diagnosing memory problems. Prior to that, the last type added was a special base type for S4 objects added in 2005.

In total, there are 25 different base types. They are listed below, loosely grouped according to where they're discussed in this book.

*   Vectors, Chapter \@ref(vectors-chap), include types `NULL`, `logical`, 
    `integer`, `double`, `complex`, `character`, `list`, and `raw`.
    
    ```{r}
    typeof(NULL)
    typeof(1L)
    typeof(1i)
    ```

*   Functions, Chapter \@ref(functions), include types `closure` (regular R 
    functions), `special` (internal functions), and `builtin` (primitive 
    functions).
    
    ```{r}
    typeof(mean)
    typeof(`[`)
    typeof(sum)    
    ```
    
    Internal and primitive functions are described in Section 
    \@ref(primitive-functions).

*   Environments, Chapter \@ref(environments), have type `environment`.

    ```{r}
    typeof(globalenv())
    ```

*   Language components, Chapter \@ref(expressions), include `symbol` (aka 
    name), `language` (usually called calls), and `pairlist` (used for function 
    arguments) types.

    ```{r}
    typeof(quote(a))
    typeof(quote(a + 1))
    typeof(formals(mean))
    ```
 
    `expression` is a special purpose type that's only returned by  `parse()` 
    and `expression()`. Expressions are generally not needed in user code.

*   The `S4` type, Chapter \@ref(s4), is used for S4 classes that don't inherit 
    from an existing base type.
   
    ```{r}
    mle_obj <- stats4::mle(function(x = 1) (x - 2) ^ 2)
    typeof(mle_obj)
    ```
 
*   The remaining types are esoteric and rarely seen in R. They are important 
    primarily for C code: `externalptr`, `weakref`, `bytecode`, `promise`, 
    `...`, and `any`.

You may have heard of `mode()` and `storage.mode()`. I recommend avoiding these functions because they just provide S compatible aliases of `typeof()`. Read their source code if you want to understand exactly what they do.

### Numeric type {#numeric-type}

Note that R uses "numeric" to mean three slightly different things:

1.  In some places it's used as an alias for "double".  For example
    `as.numeric()` is identical to `as.double()`, and `numeric()` is
    identical to `double()`.
    
    R also occasionally uses "real" instead of double; `NA_real_` is the one 
    place that you're likely to encounter this in practice.
    
1.  In S3 and S4 it is used to mean either integer or double. We'll
    talk about `s3_class()` in the next chapter:

    ```{r}
    sloop::s3_class(1)
    sloop::s3_class(1L)
    ```

1.  In `is.numeric()` it means an object built on a base type of integer or 
    double that is not a factor, i.e. an object that behaves like a number.
    
    ```{r}
    is.numeric(1)
    is.numeric(1L)
    is.numeric(factor("x"))
    ```
